How to enter a game

GameViewController:
User taps CONNECT -> connect to 1-2 other users
	-> after having maxPlayer num of users in game, connectionManager generates random number and sent to connected peers
	-> after peers received all random numbers, the user with largest randomnumber becomes the host

Host taps PLAY -> transit to levelViewController

Host chooses game mode -> connectionManager sent GameStart Message
	-> Host transit into instruction scene
	-> Host sent first trip

Peers receives GameStart Message -> peers set gameMode
	-> peers transit to instruction scene
	-> peers sent first trip to peers with larger playerID

Peer receives FirstTrip -> calculate delta and send second trip

Peer receives SecondTrip -> calculate latency and send third trip
	-> if recieved all trips
	-> transitToGame

Peer receives ThirdTrip -> calculate latency
	-> if recieved all trips
	-> transitToGame
